# Abstract 

# Introduction
The dataset utilized in this study is from the World Health Organization (WHO) in the format of an excel file that is updated on a daily basis. The data set contains information about COVID-19 cases for each of the 237 countries data was collected from. Data collection began January 3, 2020 and this report uses all data collected until March 1, 2021. The number of new cases, cumulative cases, new deaths and cumulative deaths are recorded for each day of data collection. The question of interest this report will focus on is, "Does Case Fatality Rate vary across different countries?". 

# Background 
Coronavirus is a highly contagious respiratory illness which is also known as COVID-19. This virus spreads through droplets in the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. There is no specific treatment for the virus and laboratory tests are required for confirmation of diagnosis. While most recover from COVID-19, some have symptoms that last for weeks or even months after recovering from acute illness. The long term effects of COVID-19 are not currently known and it is being investigated. Those with a higher risk of dying from COVID-19 and related complications are older people and those with underlying medical conditions. Prevention measures that can be taken against this virus include wearing facial coverings, frequent washing of hands and social distancing. In order to reduce the severity of the pandemic, limiting contact between infected individuals is important. Since the primary route of transmission of coronavirus is through respiratory particles, there is overwhelming evidence that mask wearing " reduces transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles" (Howard et al., 2021).The CDC states that the more people and longer time an individual interacts with, the higher the potential risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19. ("Community Mitigations", 2021). Guidelines regarding social gatherings are based upon national, state and local laws and regulations. Currently, there is an increase in global coronavirus cases which may be due to public health restrictions being lifted in addition to new coronavirus variants.(WHO, 2021). Multiple vaccines have been developed for emergency use and over 245 million doses have been administered in 107 countries.




# Descriptive Analysis 
This report will not analyze every country from the WHO data set. The WHO regions include African Region (AFR), Regions of the Americas (AMR), South East Asian Region (SEAR), European Region (EUR), Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) and the Western Pacific Region (WPR). This report chose the two most populated countries for each WHO region. Therefore, this report looks at Nigeria, Ethiopia, US, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Russia, Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, China and Japan. The time period selected to focus on was  the 100 days after the 100th confirmed case of COVID-19. The purpose for this was to restrict the data set to verify all countries had at least 100 confirmed coronavirus cases to avoid influencing results due to small numbers (Sorci, Faivre, & Morand, 2020). Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is all deaths from the specific disease in the population divided by all cases of the disease in the population. It is important to note that CFR is not an accurate measure of the mortality risk of the disease during a pandemic.

Plots for Nigeria are shown below. Plot of new cases shows a somewhat negative linear trend of new cases over time. In the second plot, there seems to be one data point that appears to be an outlier while the daily number of new deths tends to stay below 20.

This analysis also wants to look at Case Fatality Rate (CFR) to estimate the proportion of deaths among the identified confirmed cases. It appears that Nigeria, Brazil, and Indonesia have a negative linear trend. USA, Turkey and Japan have a nonlinear trend. Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Egypt and China do not have a clear trend while Russia has a postive trend.

# Statistical Approach
For statistical analysis, regression modeling will be employed. Through the descriptive analysis, it has been learned that data points are scattered mostly in a non-linear faction across every country under observation. Therefore, polynomial regression will be fitted according to human intuition. As it is known, there is a trade off between variance and bias for polynomial regression. While a high degree regression may represent every data point accurately, it does not necessarily reflect a meaningful trend and is incomparable to other regressions. Hence, the degree of polynomial regression is considered under a low bias, low variance basis, instead of sacrificing one for the other.

# Results 


For an actual answer to our question of interest, there will be two approaches to reach suitable results: ANOVA, and confidence bands.

In the following ANOVA models, data across all 12 countries will be fit into a regression of a certain polynomial, the same data set will then be fit into the same level of polynomial but with regards to each country. ANOVA will attempt to compare the two regression models to prove if country does have an effect on CFR over time. 

Since this type of ANOVA model can only use one chosen degree of polynomials, the third and fourth degree will be tested since they are the most common regressions fitted above.
```{r}
binddata = rbind(nigeria,ethiopia,usa,brazil,india,indonesia,russia,turkey,pakistan,egypt,china,japan)

fit0 <- lm(CFR ~ poly(time, 3), data = binddata)
fit1 <- lm(CFR ~ poly(time, 3)*Country, data = binddata)

anova(fit0,fit1)

fit3 <- lm(CFR ~ poly(time, 4), data = binddata)
fit4 <- lm(CFR ~ poly(time, 4)*Country, data = binddata)

anova(fit3,fit4)
```
As shown, the p-value is extremely low for both comparisons. This means that country does have an strong statistical effect on CFR over time for both regressions of third and fourth degree.

From the residual vs fitted and qq plots of the twelve countries, we observe that the model assumptions for the regression conducted are roughly met. The residual plots for all countries roughly exhibit homoscedasticity. The qq plots for the countries show the normality assumption is met as most of the points on the plots fall along the same line (indicating that our distribution has the same shape as the theoretical distribution). 

##ANOVA Plots

```{r}
binddata = rbind(nigeria,ethiopia,usa,brazil,india,indonesia,russia,turkey,pakistan,egypt,china,japan)

fit0 <- lm(CFR ~ poly(time, 3), data = binddata)
fit1 <- lm(CFR ~ poly(time, 3)*Country, data = binddata)

anova(fit0,fit1)

plot(fit0,1)
plot(fit0,2)
plot(fit1)
```

The residual plot of fit0 (the model with time as the only predictor) contains points randomly scattered around zero. Most of the points of the qqplot of fit0 lie along the same line, Therefore, homoscedasticity and normality assumptions are met.

The residual plot of fit1 (the model with time as the only predictor) contains points randomly scattered around zero. Most of the points of the qqplot of fit1 lie along the same line, Therefore, homoscedasticity and normality assumptions are met.

# Conclusion
This report aimed to investigate how Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for COVID-19 changes across time for 12 highly populated countries in the world (2 most populated countries per WHO region)  over the first hundred days after the number of cumulative cases hits 100 in each country. Through a series of statistical analysis, this report was able to analyze the hypothesis stated earlier.

It was hypothesized that the trends of CFR will vary significantly across these countries. The results of this report aligned with the initial hypothesis. Through fitting the 12 observed countries’ CFR across time, a variety of regressions were chosen that best fits the data. These polynomial regressions vary in correlation and degree of polynomials, which visually supports the hypothesis that CFR across time will be different for the countries. 

For statistical and quantitative proof, employing ANOVA compares the polynomial regression that is not blocked by countries to the contrary. Since these regressions have a degree of mainly 3 and 4, these polynomial regressions were chosen for the ANOVA analysis. With an extremely low p-value for both polynomial degrees of 3 and 4, it was proven that countries do have a significant statistical effect on CFR across time. Therefore, this demonstrated that CFR over time is not constant over different countries at a high significant level. 

In order to be more specific and conduct a more detailed analysis, comparing the country’s regression lines side by side demonstrates the difference between countries’ CFR over time. The use of simultaneous confidence bands, which shows the 95% confidence interval across the whole regression line, appears even though some countries do share a similar trend and overlaps, the majority of regressions were very different from one another.  Once again proving that CFR trends over time is different for each country.

Looking at these regressions may reflect how countries are able or not able to react in controlling the virus. It is observed that most CFR trends are fluctuating across the timeframe. A drop after a peak might be due to the implementation of a certain policy or a country gaining better knowledge on how to contain and treat the virus. While an increase after a trough may be hints of hitting medical capacity or loosening of policies. There are many external factors and reasons to explore beyond numbers of COVID cases and deaths. These are topics that can be delved deeper in further and more complicated analysis, however are all mere guesses at the current analysis.

The answer to the question of interest can be described as resounding and clear. However, it is important to note that this topic of interest has its own flaws and concerns to consider when interpreting the results.  In terms of the dataset itself, the prevalence of reported cases and deaths varies between countries. This may be due to socioeconomic, political and cultural differences in each country. The number of observations for each country is limited, which amplifies the variance caused by outliers. Forming the question of interest was also based on a lot of logical assumptions that may not be statistically or scientifically true. 

As the question of interest states, this report hopes to discover if there are significant differences in CFR over the first 100 days over a 100 cases. The regression lines for each country are in no intention to be predictive, rather to be a reflection of a specific trend during a specific time. The choice of countries and the choice of the timeframe are all factors to be aware of when interpreting the regressions. Unfair comparisons between countries may be made, for example a country that has a later time frame because of reaching hundred cases later may have better knowledge on the virus than countries that were affected earlier.

Overall, this report has been conclusive while assessed along with limitations. For further research, the reasons behind the trend can be explored, which could branch into a multitude of topics in politics, culture and science.
